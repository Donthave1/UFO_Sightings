# Destination: Mars Live Feed 

## Objective
Create a basic HTML web page and read in UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to the web page and then display table per each search.

Use JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

## Approach
Tools:

* JavaScript, D3.js, HTML, CSS, Boostrap 

### Here is the link to the actual page:
[UFO Sightings]()

Starting off with this [index.html](https://github.com/Donthave1/Data_Analytics_Bootcamp_UCI/blob/master/02%20Assignments/12%20UFO%20Sighting/index.html) file, I incorporate D3.js to be able to target my selection on the user input and button action. Mapping through the provided [data set](https://github.com/Donthave1/Data_Analytics_Bootcamp_UCI/blob/master/02%20Assignments/12%20UFO%20Sighting/static/js/data.js) to be able to build the table dynamically. I also implemented table reset function to be able to show search result more clean rather than cluster of search results.
